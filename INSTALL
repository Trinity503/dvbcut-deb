DVBCUT INSTALL -- last edited 2016-06-22

In order to compile dvbcut, you need to have the following libraries
installed:

* Qt, version 5 (when building just the dvbcut.pro Qt 4 should work too.)
* libao (for sound output)
* libmad and liba52 for MP2 and AC3 decoding, respectively.
* ffmpeg (libavformat, libavcodec, libavutil, libswscale)

On a Debian system, the following packages should do the job: 
  apt-get install \
    qt5-qmake qtbase5-dev qtbase5-dev-tools qttools5-dev-tools \
    autotools-dev pkg-config \
    libao-dev libmad0-dev liba52-0.7.4-dev \
    libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libavutil-dev libswscale-dev

If you have MPlayer installed on your machine (and it is accessible as
"mplayer"), you can play the videos inside DVBCUT.

How to compile DVBCUT:

* Unpack the dvbcut source archive and enter the dvbcut directory.
* Type 'autoconf && ./configure && make'.
  If everything works well, you can run DVBCUT with 'src/dvbcut'.
  To install it, run 'make install' (as root).
