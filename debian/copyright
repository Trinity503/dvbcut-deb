Comment:
 Original Source: https://dvbcut.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/dvbcut
 The original upstream author could not be reached in the last
 3 years by different Debian maintainer leaving this
 repository abandoned.
 Therefore no one can take over the sourceforge site too.
 For this reason this "temporary" github repository got created
 that include the history of the sourceforge repo, integrate
 to some extend the releases done in Debian git
 http://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/pkg-multimedia/dvbcut.git/
 and some patches taken from the repository
 https://github.com/nextghost/dvbcut-qt4 .
